## v1.1.0 - Add Show arbitrary issue title

- Add `linear show <identifier>` to show the title of an issue. Useful for copying the title into the clipboard: `linear show <identifier> | pbcopy`

## v1.0.0 - List issues ordered by sort order

This causes issues to be listed in the same order as they appear in the UI. Dragging an issue to the top of TODO in the UI will now cause it to appear at the top of the CLI output
