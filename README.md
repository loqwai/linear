# linear
CLI for interacting with Linear tickets

## Running

You'll need to create a config file at `~/.config/linear/config.toml` that provides your API key & team name. API keys can be generated at https://linear.app/sibi/settings/api.

```toml
# ~/.config/linear/config.toml
api_key = "<api-key>"
team_name = "Headless"
```
